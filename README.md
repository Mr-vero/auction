# Art Auction & C2C Platform Development Plan

## 1. Project Overview

Our platform aims to create a robust marketplace connecting artists directly with collectors through both direct sales and dynamic auction mechanisms. The C2C (Customer to Customer) model empowers artists to maintain control over their sales while providing collectors with authentic artwork through a secure platform.

### Core Objectives
- Enable artists to showcase and sell artwork directly to collectors
- Facilitate real-time auctions with advanced bidding mechanisms
- Ensure secure transactions and artwork authenticity
- Create an engaging user experience for both artists and collectors

### Success Metrics
- Platform adoption rate (target: 1000 active users in first 3 months)
- Transaction success rate (target: 98%)
- Auction completion rate (target: 85%)
- User satisfaction score (target: 4.5/5)
